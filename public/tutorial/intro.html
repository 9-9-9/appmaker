      Welcome to Appmaker! Let's start by giving you a short tour.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div data-step="bricks">
    <p>
      These blocks over here are called "Bricks". Add them to your app simply by clicking the plus icon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bricks are neatly organized in collections. Explore all these goodies and even create your own brick if you are up for it, just click the icon.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div data-step="customize">
    <p>
      Once you choose your bricks you can customize them by changing color, size, or other attributes.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div data-step="project-settings">
    <p>
      Give your app a fancy name, description, and tag. You can also try the advanced settings to manage data.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div data-step="pages">
    <p>
      Up here you can add pages to your app.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div data-step="channels">
    <p>
      Once you add some bricks to your app you will notice these lines. They are called connectors and you can imagine them as wires that connect inputs, like a button brick, to outputs like these waving hands.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div data-step="colors">
    <p>
      If you have more than one input and output just click on the connector to switch colors. If you run out of the basics click on the + to select a color of your choice or turn them off if you don't need them.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div data-step="end">
    <p class="loud">
      That was it. Now go ahead and start clicking. Happy making!
