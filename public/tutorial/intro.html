      These blocks over here are called "Bricks". Add them to your app simply by clicking the plus icon.

      Bricks are neatly organized in collections. Explore all these goodies and even create your own brick if you are up for it, just click the icon.

  <div id="channels">
    <p>
      Once you add some bricks to your app you will notice these lines. They are called connectors and you can imagine them as wires that connect inputs, like a button brick, to outputs like these waving hands.

    <button class="next">Ok got it, Next</button>
    <a class="skip" href="#">Skip tutorial</a>
  </div>
  <div id="colors">
    <p>
      If you have more than one input and output just click on the connector to switch colors. If you run out of the basics click on the + to select a color of your choice or turn them off if you don't need them.
